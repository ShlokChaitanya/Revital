At Revital, we take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you discover and we are committed to promptly addressing them.

To report a security vulnerability, please email us at [Email](mailto:shlokchaitanya@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. We kindly request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to address it.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure policy, which means we strive to resolve security vulnerabilities in a timely manner and provide updates to the reporter as the situation progresses.

Once a security vulnerability has been addressed, we will release a security advisory detailing the vulnerability, its impact, and the steps taken to mitigate it.
